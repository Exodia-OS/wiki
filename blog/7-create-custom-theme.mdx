:::note[DWM]
currently `DWM` comes with one theme
:::

you can easily create your themes with the same steps for all WMs

- Go to `~/.config/bspwm/themes/`
- Copy an existing theme and rename it. (eg:`Etherium`)
- Edit `theme.conf`
  - ![](/img/tips/CreateCustomTheme/1.png)
- Generate `colorScheme` for the theme using `python-pywal`
  - ```bash
    wal -i /usr/share/backgrounds/Etherium.jpg
    ```
- Then Edit `polybar` config
- Then take a screenshot and save it in the theme directory with name `preview.png`
  - ![](/img/tips/CreateCustomTheme/2.png)

### Finally!
